# EmployeeManagementSystem

My employee management application allows the user to add new employees with their corresponding role title, department and salary, allows the user to delete an employee and also allows to update an employees role at the company. Using a mysql database along with the mysql and the inquirer packages, this web app is a fully functioning command line prompt to gather all the data needed to keep things clean and organized with connection querys to insert all data into the respected colums. A user is prompted with a series of questions, depending on which question the choose, new questions will appear for the correct data needed to populate the database.
